## Phase 2: Dependency Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning (Week 2)

### Tasks:
1. **Clone Repositories**:
   - Clone the target repositories.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - Build dependency graphs for `requirements.txt` and `pom.xml`.
   - Identify reused or cyclic dependencies.

3. **Search for Vulnerabilities**:
   - Use OSSF and OSV.dev to scan for library vulnerabilities.
   - Perform web searches or API calls for additional vulnerability information.

4. **Create Vulnerability Table**:
   - Compile a table of libraries and their associated vulnerabilities.

### Deliverables:
- Dependency Graphs
- Vulnerability Report

## Phase 3: Code Verification and Testing (Week 3)

### Tasks:
1. **Identify Repositories**:
   - Identify the repositories to be analyzed.

2. **Create Docker Containers**:
   - Create temporary Docker containers for the required frameworks.

3. **Install and Verify Code**:
   - Install the code in the Docker template.
   - Fix dependencies if the installation fails.
   - Run with provided dependencies and check for library updates.

4. **Run Test Cases**:
