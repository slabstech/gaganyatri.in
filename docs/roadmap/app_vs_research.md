Timebox - Research and Application 


One week build the application 
Next week make progress on research. 

This helps to maintain equilibrium for making the idea proceed without holding back on progress. 

We have made a simple application which has used most of the research idea till date. 
Make the application compliant with security and coding guidelines to utilise automation provided by organization. 

Put a week timebox to implement new features,  
By end of day 4 all feature development should be finalised, 1 day to refactor the code and documentation. 5 evenings should be enough to make progress on the path towards Autonomy on  Mars.
