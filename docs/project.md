## Inspiration
We wanted to find the satellites that look over us. Get the data from satellites and use AI models to 
give real time information of the world
## What it does
Show the data in dashboard and provide analytics using Nvidia workbench
## How we built it
Downloaded the data from satnogs, 
decoded the json data using mistral-nemo for text data,
decoded the images using llama3.2-vision-11B-instruct.
